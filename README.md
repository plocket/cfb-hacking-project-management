# cfb-hacking-project-management

# Why?
As project managers at CfB, a volunteer organization, we deal with some problems we haven't come across in the other environments. From a constant influx of often ephemeral new members to managing knowledge sharing and reducing the bus factor, many of us ad hoc project managers don't feel we have the necessary tools, both mental, physical, and digital, to tackle this challenge. This is our current attempt to help each other find options for solutions and improve our experience and that of future project managers here.

# How?
We're having this discussion for two levels of action:
1. Ideas/requests to bring to the core CfB team for them to implement to help project managers
2. Ideas that individual team leads would have to implement.

We will work on capturing those, and maybe other discussions, in [this repo's issues](https://github.com/plocket/cfb-hacking-project-management/issues) (maybe) for documentation and perhaps more input.
